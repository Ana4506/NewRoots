A women service based app built on flutter. NewRoots aims to incentivises women of India to pay their part and quiver the roots of unemployement.

Built during the Azure Women's Hackathon 2022 organised by Microsoft. 
Please note that I had 2 months to make this app in which I had to learn, ideate, design and develop the app all by myself. I have built a base app.

For your reference and better understanding I have also attached the app layouts.

## 🤔 Why NewRoots?

   My vision was to see that each n every women from vulnerable sections is financially stable and can represent              themselves as true entreprenuers and eventually help in increasing the overall economic growth. 
   To make my vision a success  my goal will be to ensure that I provide these women a platform where they can prove          themselves. This project will not only help them in getting funds but  exposure as well. 
   And through my app my mission would be to beat the roots of unemployement in our country.
